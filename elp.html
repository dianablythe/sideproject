            <p class = "text">But what if the <em>merry go round of life</em> meant more than just being born, growing up, living to work for dirty green cloth, maybe having a family and then getting old, hoping to be taking care of and live till 80 and then dying in a not so tragic way if you're lucky, deciding to believe in a higher power just in case right before and your spirit floating into the stratosphere?</p>
